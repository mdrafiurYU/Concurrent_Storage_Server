# Concurrent Storage Server
A simple storage server with client/server architecture that supports concurrency through multithreding and data synchronization.
Server-Storage
Designed storage server for Ontario Drug store to keep a record of patient prescriptions and implemented essential freatures like data modification, retrieval, deletion and query

**Milestone 1**
- Obtain a basic understanding of the storage server skeleton code provided,
- learn to build and run the storage server,
- develop a simple command-line shell for passing input and output to the storage server,
- develop simple logging capabilities for client and storage server,
- develop simple logging capabilities for client and storage server,
- understand how to follow simple instructions, e.g., assembling files into archives, etc.


**Milestone 2**


- Develop socket-based client/server programs,
- understand the basics of data management,
- understand and use simple parsing techniques.
- learn about performance evaluation
- apply parsing techniques of your choice for data cleaning and transformations


**Milestone 3**


- implement more advanced parsing functions
- experiment with more complex queries
- extend the data schema types supported by the storage server
- continue to add unit tests and use the unit testing framework
- apply code-generation-based parsing techniques to simplify parsing development


**Milestone 4**


- understand concurrency and synchronization
- use multi-tasking and multi-processing (optionally) for concurrency
- learn about light-weight transactions, especially about atomicity
- quantify the performance implications of concurrency
